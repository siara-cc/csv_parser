# csv_parser
This is an advanced CSV parser that uses RFC4180 as basis.

In addition, it allows the user to preview the size of a column before it is extracted.  This can be used to determine whether to extract the column or not.  For instance, memory related issues.

It also allows comments and empty lines within CSV.
